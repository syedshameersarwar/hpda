One recent high-powered data analytics use case from science is the analysis of data
from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In this use case, data from the 
LHC experiments is processed to search for new particles and phenomena in the universe.

The LHC produces vast amounts of data, with approximately 25 petabytes of data being
generated annually. The data analytics workflow for analyzing this data involves 
several steps, including data collection, filtering, and analysis. 
The entire workflow can take several months to complete, depending on 
the complexity of the analysis.

The 5V challenges of big data apply to this use case in the following ways:

Volume: 
As mentioned, the LHC generates a large amount of data, which must be processed in 
order to extract useful information.

Velocity: 
The data must be processed quickly in order to keep up with the high rate at which
it is generated.

Variety: 
The data comes from a variety of sources, including detectors and other 
instruments, and has different formats and structures.

Veracity: 
The data must be reliable and accurate in order to provide meaningful results.

Value: 
The data must be used effectively in order to make new discoveries and 
advance our understanding of the universe.
