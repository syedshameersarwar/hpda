One recent high powered data analytics use case from the industry is the use of
data analytics by the National Football League (NFL) to analyze player performance 
and improve team strategies.

The NFL processes a large amount of data from various sources, including player and 
team statistics, game footage, and player health data. This data is used to 
identify trends and patterns in player performance, such as individual strengths and weaknesses, 
and to develop strategies for improving team performance.

The workflow for this use case involves the collection and integration of data from 
multiple sources,  followed by advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to
identify trends and patterns. The process is run continuously, 
with data being collected and analyzed on a regular basis to support 
real-time decision making by teams and coaches.

In terms of the 5V challenges of big data, the NFL's use of data analytics involves 
dealing with a large volume of data, with each game generating thousands of data points. 
The data is also highly varied, with multiple sources and types of data being 
integrated into the analysis. The data is also generated and processed at high velocity, 
with real-time analysis and decision making being critical for success. Finally, 
the data is of high value to the NFL and its teams, with the insights generated 
being used to improve player performance and team strategies.
