A HTTP-API service for exposing a hierarchical file system can have the following syntax and semantics:

1. Upload a file:
    Method: PUT
    URL: /files/{path}
    Body: binary file data
    Response: 201 (Created) if the file was successfully uploaded, 200 (Updated) if the file was successfully uploaded, 400 (Bad Request) if the request is malformed

2. Download a file:`
    Method: GET
    URL: /files/{path}
    Response: binary file data if the file exists, 404 (Not Found) if the file does not exist

3. Create a directory:
    Method: MKCOL
    URL: /files/{path}
    Response: 201 (Created) if the directory was successfully created, 400 (Bad Request) if the request is malformed, 409 (Conflict) if a file already exists at the given path

4. List contents of a directory:
    Method: GET
    URL: /files/{path}
    Response: JSON array of file and directory names in the directory, 404 (Not Found) if the directory does not exist

5. Delete a file or directory:
    Method: DELETE
    URL: /files/{path}
    Response: 200 (OK) if the file or directory was successfully deleted, 404 (Not Found) if the file or directory does not exist.

Note: The above syntax and semantics are only suggestions and can be adjusted to fit the 
      specific needs of the API. The API can also implement additional functionality such 
      as moving or copying files and directories.
