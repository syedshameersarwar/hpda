The data that should be part of the fact table would be time spent on the website, as this is the 
key metric that we want to analyze. The other attributes, such as IP address, country of visitor, 
city of visitor, access date, and browser's user agent, would be dimensions that provide context for 
the time spent on the website. These dimensions can be used to slice and dice the data in different ways 
to gain insights into how users are accessing the Wikipedia website.

A star schema is a common way to map an OLAP cube to a relational model. The central table in a star 
schema is the fact table, which contains the metrics or facts that we want to analyze. The dimensions 
are represented by separate tables that are linked to the fact table via foreign key relationships. 
For our Wikipedia logs data, we could create a star schema with the following tables:

time_spent_fact: 
    contains the time spent on the website for each user, along with a foreign key to the 
    date_dimension, location_dimension and browser_dimension tables

date_dimension:  
    contains the access date, along with attributes such as year, month, and day

location_dimension: 
    contains the country and city of the visitor, along with attributes such as region and time zone

browser_dimension: 
    contains the user agent for the browser used by the visitor, along with attributes such as 
    browser type and version
