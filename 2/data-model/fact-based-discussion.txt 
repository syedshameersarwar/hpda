Fact based vs Relational Model

A fact-based data model, also known as a dimensional data model, organizes data around the 
specific facts or events that are relevant to a particular subject. This type of model is 
often used in data warehouses and business intelligence systems, where the goal is to 
provide a clear and concise view of the data that is most relevant to decision-making.

In contrast, a relational data model is based on the concept of organizing data into tables 
or relations, where each table represents a specific entity or concept in the real world. 
Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes), and the relationships between 
tables are established through the use of common key values.

The impact of a fact-based data model on a relational data model is largely a matter of 
perspective. Some people may view the fact-based model as an alternative to the relational 
model, while others may see it as a complement to the relational model. In either case, 
the fact-based model provides a way to organize and analyze data that is focused on the 
specific facts or events that are relevant to a particular subject, rather than on the 
underlying structure of the data. This can make it easier to understand and analyze the 
data, and can help to identify trends and patterns that might not be apparent using a 
purely relational approach.

In our cases, going from relational model would make the data more dense and denormalized 
as we will start storing timestamped article versions.
