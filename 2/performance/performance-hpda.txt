Performance is a term that can refer to a number of different characteristics of a
data analytics application. These characteristics may include things like the speed 
at which the application can process data, the amount of data it can handle at once, 
and the accuracy of its results. In general, a high-performance data analytics application
is one that is able to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data.

There are several reasons why a use case might require a high-performance data analytics
application. For example, if the data being analyzed is very large or complex, 
a high-performance application may be needed to quickly and accurately process 
and make sense of the data. Additionally, if the results of the data analysis are
being used to make critical decisions or take immediate action, a high-performance 
application may be necessary in order to provide timely and accurate results.â†³

In summary, a high-performance data analytics application is one that is able to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data, 
and is well-suited to use cases that require fast and accurate analysis of complex data.
