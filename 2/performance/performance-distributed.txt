When multiple computers are interconnected to form a distributed system, the overall 
performance of the system can be expanded in several ways. One of the key ways that 
the performance of a distributed system can be expanded is by increasing the number 
of computers that are interconnected. This allows the system to distribute its workload
across multiple machines, which can increase the overall speed and efficiency of the system.

Another way that the performance of a distributed system can be expanded is by implementing 
effective communication and coordination protocols between the different computers. 
This allows the system to efficiently share data and distribute tasks among the different 
machines, which can improve the overall performance of the system.

The TOP500 list provides a number of performance characteristics for the world's fastest 
supercomputers. Some of the performance characteristics provided in the list include 
the speed of the supercomputer, measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS); 
the number of processors and cores used by the supercomputer; and the amount of memory 
available to the supercomputer. Other performance characteristics provided in the list 
include the amount of power consumed by the supercomputer, and the location and type of 
organization that operates the supercomputer.
