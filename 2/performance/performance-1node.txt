Performance in a computer system typically refers to the amount of work that the system 
can perform in a given period of time, or how quickly it can complete tasks. This can 
be affected by a number of factors, including the speed of the processor, the amount 
of memory (RAM) available, the speed and size of the storage (hard drive or solid state drive),
and the efficiency of the operating system.

Some relevant characteristics for a single computer system, such as a server or desktop, include:

Processor: The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer and is responsible 
for executing most of the instructions that the system performs. The speed of the 
processor, measured in GHz, can affect the overall performance of the system.

Memory (RAM): The system's memory (random access memory) is used to store data and 
instructions that the processor is currently working on. The more memory a system has, 
the more data it can store and manipulate at once, which can improve its performance.

Storage: The storage device, such as a hard drive or solid state drive, is used to store 
the system's operating system, programs, and data. The speed and size of the storage can 
affect how quickly the system can access and use this information, which can impact its 
performance.

Operating system: The operating system (OS) is the software that manages the system's hardware 
and provides a platform for running other programs. The efficiency of the OS can affect the 
overall performance of the system.

Typical values for a decent computer system (as of 2021) would depend on the 
specific components and configuration of the system, but some general 
guidelines for a system that would provide good performance include:

Processor: A CPU with a clock speed of at least 3-4 GHz, with multiple cores for better 
performance on multi-threaded tasks.

Memory: At least 8 GB of RAM, although 16 GB or more is recommended for better performance, 
especially for tasks that require a lot of memory, such as gaming or video editing.

Storage: A solid state drive (SSD) with at least 500 GB of storage space, which provides 
faster access to data than a traditional hard drive.

Operating system: A modern and efficient OS, such as Windows 10 or macOS, that is 
well-optimized for the hardware of the system.
