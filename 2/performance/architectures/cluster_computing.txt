One example of a supercomputer architecture is cluster computing, where a group of 
interconnected computers (or "nodes") work together to perform high-speed computing. 
In this architecture, each node typically has its own processor and memory, and is 
connected to the other nodes via a high-speed network. This allows the nodes to share 
data and work together to perform complex calculations.
