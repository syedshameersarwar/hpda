Another example of a supercomputer architecture is distributed memory, where each node 
in the system has its own memory and is connected to the other nodes via a high-speed 
network. In this architecture, the nodes can access each other's memory as needed in 
order to perform calculations, allowing for very high levels of parallelism and performance.
