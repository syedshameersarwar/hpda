To store individual Wikipedia articles in a MongoDB, we can use the following data model:

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  text: String,
  categories: [String],
  links: [String]
}

The `_id` field is the unique identifier for each document and is automatically generated by MongoDB. 
The `title` field stores the title of the Wikipedia article, the `text` field stores the content 
of the article, the `categories` field is an array of strings that store the categories the article 
belongs to, and the `links` field is an array of strings that store the links to other articles in 
the Wikipedia data.

We'll create the index on `title` field as  follows (in Python)

db.articles.create_index([('title', pymongo.ASCENDING)])

Alongwith that, we'll add a "text" index on `text` field to enhance performace for full-text search
queries on articles text.

db.articles.create_index([('text', 'text')])
